spools is a content scraping library for instagram's [Threads](https://threads.net).
spools aims to provide a more comfortable interface than Threads' cumbersome and obfuscated
internal API, with the added bonus of not requiring an account.

spools is co-developed alongside [Shoelace](https://sr.ht/~nixgoat/shoelace), a private frontend
for Threads.
